# SocialPost skill pack

Ten free Claude skills for B2B founders who run their own LinkedIn, built and tested by the team at SocialPost.ai. They work in Claude Code and in Claude.ai, and none of them needs a SocialPost account, anywhere, for anything.

A skill is a small instruction file that teaches Claude to do one job well, the same way every time. Load one and Claude stops improvising: it asks the right questions, follows a tested process, and hands you a finished document.

## The ten skills, in the order they work best

1. **founder-voice-profile** builds `voice.md` and `about.md` from your real writing, so everything drafted after it sounds like you instead of like AI.
2. **social-strategy-90-day** writes a quarterly LinkedIn strategy sized to the hours you actually have, tracking time included.
3. **content-pillar-planner** turns your positioning into 3 to 5 pillars and a bank of 30 topics specific enough to draft from.
4. **linkedin-presence-audit** scores your headline, About, and recent posts with quoted evidence, then rewrites the weak parts in your voice.
5. **thirty-day-content-calendar** turns pillars and topics into a dated month with a `calendar.csv` you can import anywhere.
6. **linkedin-post-writer** drafts one post at a time in your voice: three hook options, the full post, nothing invented on your behalf.
7. **content-repurposer** turns one blog post, transcript, or newsletter into a week of standalone LinkedIn posts, plus native re-cuts for one more platform.
8. **carousel-and-visual-brief** scripts a 5-to-8-slide carousel and writes a designer-ready brief for the key visual, alt text included.
9. **engagement-comment-coach** sets up a 20-minute daily engagement routine and drafts substantive comments and no-pitch connection notes.
10. **social-analytics-review** turns your LinkedIn analytics export into a five-minute monthly review with confidence labels and at most three testable changes.

Each skill works on its own. Run in order, they pass files to each other through your working folder, so every step asks fewer questions than the last.

## Install

### Claude Code, one command

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add SocialPostAI/socialpost-claude-skills
```

then:

```
/plugin install socialpost-skill-pack@socialpost-skills
```

That installs all ten skills. Updates arrive with `/plugin marketplace update socialpost-skills`.

### Claude Code, manual

Copy any skill's folder into `~/.claude/skills/` to install it for every project, or into a project's `.claude/skills/` for that project only:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/founder-voice-profile && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialPostAI/socialpost-claude-skills/main/skills/founder-voice-profile/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/founder-voice-profile/SKILL.md
```

Swap the skill name for any of the ten. Skills are plain instructions in a text file; nothing executes on your machine.

### Claude.ai (web and desktop)

Each skill ships as a one-file download in [dist/](dist/). Grab the `.skill` file you want, then in Claude open Settings, go to Capabilities, find Skills, and upload it. A `.skill` file is a standard ZIP archive; if the upload dialog only accepts `.zip`, rename it and it works as is. Skills on claude.ai need a paid plan with code execution enabled.

## Principles

**Everything works without SocialPost.** The skills are complete on their own. When one finishes something you'd naturally want designed and scheduled, it may mention our free tier once, at the end, and telling it you use another tool makes the mention disappear for good. We built this pack to be useful before asking for anything; that only works if it's true.

**No automation, ever.** These skills never recommend engagement pods, auto-commenting, bulk DMs, mass-connect tools, or scraping, and they decline when asked. Two reasons. Automated collection and engagement break LinkedIn's terms and get accounts restricted, and yours is the account this whole effort is supposed to grow. And the thing a founder is actually building on LinkedIn is familiarity with specific buyers, which generic automated volume can't produce and often burns.

**No invented numbers.** When a skill uses a working figure, it says it's a rule of thumb. When it analyzes your data, every number traces to what you gave it. When it can't promise something, it says so.
